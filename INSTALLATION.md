# Installation

1. Install all requirements via
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Install other dependencies
    ```bash
    cd nsfr
    pip install -e .
    cd ..
    cd nudge
    pip install -e .
    cd ..
    ```

3. Optional: Install NEUMANN dependencies for memory-efficient reasoning. This will be required only when the nsfr reasoner produces an out-of-memory error due to highly-parallelized environment, e.g. 512 environments in Seaquest.
    ```bash
    cd neumann
    pip install -e .
    ```
    It requires [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) and its dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install torch-scatter
    pip install torch-sparse
    pip install torch-geometric
    ```
For Mac users, you may need to install `torch-geometric` from source. Please refer to the [official installation guide](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).
```
git clone https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter.git
cd pytorch_scatter
python setup.py install
```

4. You can now run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train_blenderl.py --env-name seaquest --joint-training --num-steps 128 --num-envs 5 --gamma 0.99
    ```

5. You can also run the evaluation script:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --env-name seaquest --agent-path out/runs/models/seaquest_demo
    ```
